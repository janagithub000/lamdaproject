    <h3><p>A cloud engineer is an IT professional who builds and maintains cloud infrastructure. Cloud engineers can have more specific roles that include cloud architecting (designing cloud solutions for organisations), development (coding for the cloud), and administration (working with cloud networks). 
        Cloud technology has become ubiquitous in recent years, with this technology being used when you’re watching TV, listening to music on streaming services, or using an email platform. For a company, it means data can be stored and backed up more easily, software updates can be rolled out on-demand, and customers may be able to access their information from different devices. You’ll work behind the scenes as a cloud engineer to keep it all running.</p></h3>
