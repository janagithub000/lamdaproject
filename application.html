    <h2><p>In order to facilitate the development of applications for mobile devices, and consistency thereof, various approaches have been taken.

        Most companies that ship a product (e.g. Apple, iPod/iPhone/iPad) provide an official software development kit (SDK). They may also opt to provide some form of Testing and/or Quality Assurance (QA). In exchange for being provided the SDK or other tools, it may be necessary for a prospective developer to sign a some form of non-disclosure agreement, or NDA, which restricts the sharing of privileged information
        As part of the development process, mobile user interface (UI) design is an essential step in the creation of mobile apps. Mobile UI designers consider constraints, contexts, screen space, input methods, and mobility as outlines for design. Constraints in mobile UI design in constraints include the limited attention span of the user and form factors, such as a mobile device's screen size for a user's hand(s). Mobile UI context includes signal cues from user activity, such as the location where or the time when the device is in use, that can be observed from user interactions within a mobile app. Such context clues can be used to provide automatic suggestions when scheduling an appointment or activity or to filter a list of various services for the user.
        
        The user is often the focus of interaction with their device, and the interface entails components of both hardware and software. User input allows for the users to manipulate a system, and device's output allows the system to indicate the effects of the users' manipulation.</p></h2>
